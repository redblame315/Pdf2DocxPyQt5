Sure! Below is a more detailed and comprehensive JSON structure typically used in an e-commerce system to represent an order, including customer information, products, payment, shipping, and more complex scenarios like discount, taxes, and promotional codes.

This JSON structure can be extended based on specific business requirements. Iâ€™ve added additional features such as coupon codes, tax calculations, order comments, and shipment tracking.
